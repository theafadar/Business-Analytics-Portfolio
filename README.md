## About

Hi, my name is Anas Afadar. 
I became interested in the world of analytics and data recently. I have a long experience in digital and social project management and currently becoming more interested recently in the technical aspect such as databases and cloud.
As part of my learning journey, I am working on different projects that can showcase several applications of Python and SQL.
